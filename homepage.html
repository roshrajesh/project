            <p>
                Marian is envisioned as a Centre of Excellence in higher learning where knowledge is intended to become ‘Knowledge Plus’ through reflection, introspection, and fine-tuning (Saadhana) of oneself. Marian is a place where
                 ‘tireless striving and efforts stretch its arms towards perfection’.
                  Our intentions shall always be to excel in every way so that our today has to be better than our yesterday, and our tomorrow has to be better than our today. At Marian, quality is not an act, it is a practice.
